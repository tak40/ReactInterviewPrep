/**
 * React Limitations
 * -----------------
 * Not necessarily a bad thing but something you want to be aware of in the interview process.
 *
 * - It is a library, not a framework
 *   - This doesn’t mean it's a good or bad thing, but there are some pros and cons.
 *   - Library enhances your existing code. You could write a whole JavaScript application and 
 *     incorporate React into parts of it. It was a big selling point when React first emerged.
 *   - Being a library, it lets developers roam free. Some need a framework, hence we have 
 *     Gatsby, Next.js, etc., which are built on top of React.
 *
 * - It is large
 *   - This isn’t necessarily bad, especially if you have code splitting and certain best 
 *     practices in place.
 *   - There are smaller versions like Preact which function similarly but are lighter.
 *
 * - Being owned by Facebook
 *   - Pros: Maintained by a large corporation, ensuring its longevity. Facebook developers 
 *     have salaries, so even though it's open source, a team within Facebook makes major 
 *     decisions.
 *   - Cons: Privacy and transparency concerns. Trust issues with Facebook's privacy? 
 *     Communication struggles with the internal team have been reported, despite React being open source.
 *
 * - Documentation
 *   - It's not as up-to-date as it should be.
